It is a #frontend #movies and #shows #webapp with many cool features listed below :
- Search Movies and Shows dynamically
- Sort results in 6 different ways:
1. Increasing/Decreasing Rating
2. Increasing/Decreasing Date of Release/Air
3. Alphabetical/Reverse Alphabetical order
- Each result has a poster, rating bar and year of release, airing is display with an overview in a card component
- Read more about each movie/shows on clicking the read more
- Each details page has seasons for shows and cast and similar movies/shows
- Provider search option in the details where we can search where to watch the movie/show in a particular country
- We have an option to load the next page of results. If there are none present it reloads the first page

I have used the #tmdb #api for the information and the #watchprovider #service provided by the TMDB website.
